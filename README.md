# ae-csv-to-credits
After Effects script to convert a character separated values (CSV) document to a credits crawl. The script will generate a comp of specified width and variable height based on number of credits entries. The comp will be 1 frame long with the intention of the user rendering a PNG sequence from it (resulting in a single PNG) to then re-import into the project and animate as needed.

(This ReadMe could use some work... That's a later issue)
